# Contributing
## High Level Overview
1. Fork the project
2. Commit all work to your dev branch
3. Open a PR to merge your forked dev branch into the project's dev branch
## **Before** you open the PR checklist
1. Use [Prettier](https://prettier.io) to format all of your code (make sure the .prettierrc configurations are respected)
2. Fix all [Eslint](https://eslint.org) error messages (once again make sure the .eslintrc.js configurations are respected)  
**NOTE:** Both of the above can be done via extensions to your IDE -- Google or ask me for help if needed.
3. Document code where necessary (this is up to your discretion and if I request it in the PR) using [JSDoc](https://jsdoc.app)
4. Make sure there are no magic variables (i.e. `const x = ...`) unless it is obvious and you put in a comment explaining what it is
5. Write tests in the `/tests` directory

### React
1. Make sure you include PropTypes declarations for all components

## When opening the PR
1. Please briefly explain what it is you coded
2. Please briefly explain your approach (new components added? modified? removed?)
3. Any packages added/updated/removed
